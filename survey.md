# Wharton Network Governance Disclosure Questionnaire

1. Respondent(s)
    1. Which network are you providing answers for in this questionnaire? 
    1. Name of respondent(s)? (Legal names, pseudonyms, usernames, etc. are all valid responses)
    1. What is your role in the network?

1. Background
    1. How do you define the purpose, goals, or scope of the network? 
    1. What do you consider success for the network? Do you have metrics to measure success? If so, what are they?
    1. What, if any, are the coordinating entities associated with this network, and what are their functions? (E.g. foundation, development corporation, DAO, etc.) 
    1. Are network participants identified (i.e. keypair associated with accounts or UTXOs, wallet number, government ID, etc.)? If so, how?

1. Stakeholder Groups
    1. Are there currently groups without whom the project collapses? (e.g. the group of core developers pre-launch; the group of funders) - if so, describe them. 
    1. Does the network’s dry code (coded/machine-executable) recognize or delineate different groups? If so, how and who?
    1. Are different groups delineated by the wet code (informal/social, formal/legal structures) of the network? If so, how and who? 
    1. Are there groups, not already incorporated in answers to prior questions, directly affected by the network’s operation (positively or negatively)? If so, who and how?
    1. Are there groups, not already incorporated in answers to prior questions, indirectly affected by the network’s operation (positively or negatively)? If so, who and how?
    1. Are there other groups that impact or are impacted by the network not identified in answers to questions 7-11? If so, who?
    
    In the following questions, we use intrinsic groups to refer to the groups identified in questions 7, 8, and 9; and extrinsic groups to refer to groups identified in questions 10, 11 and 12. 
    
    1. How can users gain access to/exit each intrinsic group?
    1. How can each intrinsic group gain the ability to interact with the network, or with other groups (including access/contributions/mere observation)?
    1. Are there mechanisms to prevent or limit the interaction of an intrinsic or extrinsic group with the network, or with other groups? If so, how do those mechanisms operate?
    1. Are there mechanisms to include specific intrinsic or extrinsic groups in the various aspects of the network? If so, how do those mechanisms operate?
    1. Does the network and its governance accommodate an increase in the number of groups, diversity, or size of an intrinsic group? How?
    1. Are there groups identified in question 7-12 whose interests you believe should NOT be considered by the network’s governance? Which groups and why?
    1. What are the costs of exiting the network? (eg. loss of data, time, money, status, connectivity)
    1. What are the costs of exiting a particular intrinsic group? (eg. loss of data, time, money, status, connectivity)

1. Incentive Schemes
    1. What behaviours does the network seek to incentivize? 
    1. How are such behaviours incentivized, implicitly or explicitly? (E.g., financial benefits, belief in shared values, costs of network failure, or costs of exiting the network)
    1. When and how do participants have ‘skin in the game’ (exposure)? (E.g. financial, reputation, legal, etc)
    1. In the case that the network is already launched, how well are the incentives functioning in practice? What unintended consequences are visible or anticipated, if any? Were revisions to the incentive schemes made, or are they planned?
    1. Is there a fund or system for paying for infrastructure, protocol upgrades, development work, network enhancements and/or other work deemed to be in the interest of the network? 
        1. If no: what are the incentives for upgrades and enhancements?
        1. If yes: what is funded by whom? Who performs the work? Who judges the work? What recourse is there if work is below quality? 
        1. If yes: How is the fund protected from looting, capture, or other forms of abuse? What reporting requirements, if any, are individuals and teams who receive funds from "coordinating entities" or "the protocol" required to adhere to?

1. Governance Powers
    1. What do you consider the sources/roots of the network’s governance legitimacy/authority? 
    1. Who has power to introduce proposals (non-binding signals, binding votes, or other proposals)?
        1. Which of the “stakeholder groups”, as very broadly defined in Section II, have which types of policy setting power?
        1. How does a stakeholder group attain or lose this power? 
    1. Who has policy setting (“legislative") power to decide on proposals?
        1. Which of the “stakeholder groups”, as very broadly defined in Section II, have which types of policy setting power?
        1. How does a stakeholder group attain or lose this power? 
    1. Who has implementation (“executive”) power to execute (carry out or enact) proposals, once decided upon?
        1. Which stakeholder groups have which types of executive power? 
        1. How does a stakeholder group attain or lose this power?  
    1. Who has interpretive (“judicial”) power to decide how to apply an agreed policy to a specific instance?
        1. Which stakeholder groups have which types of interpretive power?
        1. How does a stakeholder group attain or lose this power?  
    1. Does this network facilitate transparency with regard to the use of governance powers? (i.e., are there "information clearing mechanisms” for instances of abuse or effective use)
        1. How do these mechanisms operate? 
        1. Are there different degrees of transparency for different stakeholder groups? 
        1. How does a stakeholder group attain or lose this power? 

1. Governance Procedure
    1. How are conflicts resolved?
    1. What checks and balances/systems of accountability exist among the governance powers in Section V?
    1. Is there an explicit system for signals (non-binding) or votes (binding) on network governance decisions? 
        1. If a voting or signaling scheme is used: How is the information about a vote or signal communicated, are explanations given, consequences and impacts of the different proposals explained, in which languages? How long is this information available? How are network participants able to respond to potential changes, if otherwise?
        1. If there is voting, how is the voting system structured/conveyed? Who has the right to vote, and for what? 
        1. If there are signals, how is the signal system structured/conveyed? Who has the right to signal, for what? 
        1. Is voting or signal history public or private? For how long? By wallet/network address or equivalent (see question 6) or by group?
    1. Consider the system’s rules and norms encoded in “wet code” (informal/social, formal/legal) and/or “dry code” (coded/machine-executable), whether discussed or not in answers to the questionnaire thus far.  
For each: 
        1. Are there aspects that can be changed by ordinary processes, for example: via majority votes, Bitcoin soft forks (“statutory rules and norms")? If so, what are they?
        1. Are there aspects that can be changed by extraordinary processes, for example: via supermajority votes, non-contentious Bitcoin hard forks ("constitutional rules and norms")? If so, what are they?
        1. Are there intrinsic aspects that should never be changed, for example: only via revolution/coup/contentious Bitcoin hard fork ("core rules and norms”)? If so, what are they? 
    1. Are there governance mechanisms, in either intention or effect, that make changing the network easier, or harder? As non-exhaustive examples:
        1. How are potential future changes communicated to participants in the network? 
        1. Are there mandatory waiting or execution periods (for comment period, delay prior to voting or execution, time limit to vote or execute a proposed change, opportunity to exit the network, etc.)?
    1. What major revisions to the governance of the network have been made, or are under current consideration? Why were/are revisions made or considered? (not already discussed in question 24)
